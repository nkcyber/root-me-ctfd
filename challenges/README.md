# Challenges

This folder contains several folders, each of which are collections of challenges.
Each `challenge.yml` specifies a challenge to be created in CTFd.

Students will progress linearly through each collection of challenges.

[`services`](../services) will read flags from the challenge's `challenge.yml`, so file paths are important.

When adding `challenge.yml`, consult the [challenge example](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli/blob/master/ctfcli/spec/challenge-example.yml) for reference.
